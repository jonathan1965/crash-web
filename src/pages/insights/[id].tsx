            Adjudication: Rwanda's Delayed Potential In Construction Disputes

              Disputes in contracts are an inevitability that cannot be avoided. The construction industry is no
exception to the susceptibility to disputes, and its very distinctive nature, in particular, poses a
legal question about how to best handle such disputes in a timely manner that maintains a
consistent cashflow.
              </section>

              A construction boom is on the rise in Rwanda and in the last two decades, it has experienced an
exponential growth with earnings from the sector rising over 60% since 2012. GDP From
Construction in Rwanda increased to 181 RWF Billion in the first quarter of 2022 from 180 RWF
Billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 courtesy of the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda. It
contributes around 8 percent to national employment.
              </section>
              <section>
              It is a no brainer that the government’s investor-friendly policy has contributed a great deal to this
growth but factors such as the emerging middle class which has prompted the growth of the real
estate sub-sector in affordable housing, government’s massive investment in infrastructure
among others have had their share of contribution to this growth.
Yet, as the construction industry grows so do disputes arising from construction projects and
contracts. The uncertain and complex nature of construction projects makes such long-term
transactions susceptible to disputes as it is almost impossible to cover all the tiny details and
foresee every eventuality at the outset.
              </section>
              <section>
              The occurrence of disputes can be devastating especially when projects haven’t been
completed. The implication of such as occurrence is that projects can be put on hold until such
disputes are settled, and in instances where they are not, cashflow is greatly affected, a crucial
tool for the day-to-day running of construction projects. Dispute resolution therefore, steps in as a form of damage control and aims to restore parties to their former positions before the dispute
arose.
              </section>

              <section>
              Rwandan law avails a number of remedies parties can resort to in the occurrence of disputes
namely; negotiation, mediation, arbitration and litigation.
Of the accessible options, litigation is the popularly chosen one. With negotiations failing over
and over, the non-binding nature of mediation, and arbitration as a relatively new concept,
litigation remains the most sought-after remedy.
Litigation entails a rigorous court process where a party files a case in a public court under what
legal scholars’ term as civil action. Once the case has been admitted, the uncertainty of how long
it may take, postponements, the outcome, the high cost of lawyers’ fees are a few of the parties’
expectations. Hence, when you consider the fact the public nature of the hearings and lack of
confidentiality thereof, the long court procedure which may even include appeal making litigation
a significant time consumer taking more than 12 months to reach the final verdict, litigation in
construction disputes thus becomes more detrimental in the long-run!
              </section>
              <section>The good news for those in the construction industry is that not all remedies have been
exhausted by the lawmakers and Adjudication could be an option parties in construction
disputes could leverage in getting their disputes settled and projects up and running at minimal
costs and time.</section>
<section>Adjudication involves an independent third party considering the claims of both sides and
making a binding decision. It is a simple and efficient method of settling disputes in a relatively
speedy and cost-effective manner in comparison to other forms of dispute resolution which
makes it the most favourable approach in construction cases.
What makes Adjudication even more efficient is that adjudicators tend to be persons with direct
experience in construction matters. These vary from architects, engineers, quantity surveyors or
lawyers with specific construction knowledge and experience. Confidentiality of the adjudication
process, the fact that you can adjudicate anytime and the enforceability of the adjudication
decision are few of the many advantages of adjudication in construction disputes.</section>
<section>Adjudication as a mode of dispute resolution has since long been adopted in jurisdictions such
the UK, Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand, Kenya, South Africa, and some states of Australia in
the construction industry. In most cases, it is statutory with the objective of improving and
maintain cashflow in the industry with the theme of “pay now, fight later”, where institutions have
been established to ensure the smooth sailing of the Adjudication procedure and it has proved
to be nothing less than effective.</section>
<section>Rwanda needs to follow suit with a comprehensive legislative and institutional structure for
incorporating adjudication into our conflict resolution mechanism. This would be set up in such a
way that adjudication is the first choice in construction disputes, that it is designed to resolve
such issues in the shortest amount of time possible, and that it is mandatory in nature. Producing the appropriate skills, regulations, and institutions for adjudication would provide some
confidence and backup in the event of a conflict, while also acting as an incentive for investors.
With Rwanda set to be Africa’s top investment hub, there is no doubt that construction is going to
take the lion’s share of such investments especially in housing and other infrastructure!
Establishing the necessary legal and institutional framework for adjudication could come in
handy!</section>
